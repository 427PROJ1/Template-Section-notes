It seems like some information is useful such as address contact info, but some seems unnecessary. 
Some of the infmoration is likely out of date when considering prices
The information, for example when clicking on read full post on feagans page, is hectic. The page seems long and visually unappealing
For the sub section for coffee, it is unnecesary to include starbucks or dunks. if visitors were looking to go there they can easily use their phones for nearest location
I dont think layers of the subpost should overlap, right now when you click on eerie boul and coffee the same place pops up.
There should be more clear and seperate sections
I think it is a positive when the atmosphere of a restaurant is cleary articulated
Ethnic groceries only has one post.
Farmers markets has zero posts.
